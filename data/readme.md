Loan Approval Classification Dataset

About Dataset
1. Data Source
This dataset is a synthetic version inspired by the original Credit Risk dataset on Kaggle and enriched with additional variables based on Financial Risk for Loan Approval data. SMOTENC was used to simulate new data points to enlarge the instances. The dataset is structured for both categorical and continuous features.

2. Metadata
The dataset contains 45,000 records and 14 variables, each described below:

Column	Description	Type
person_age	Age of the person	Float
person_gender	Gender of the person	Categorical
person_education	Highest education level	Categorical
person_income	Annual income	Float
person_emp_exp	Years of employment experience	Integer
person_home_ownership	Home ownership status (e.g., rent, own, mortgage)	Categorical
loan_amnt	Loan amount requested	Float
loan_intent	Purpose of the loan	Categorical
loan_int_rate	Loan interest rate	Float
loan_percent_income	Loan amount as a percentage of annual income	Float
cb_person_cred_hist_length	Length of credit history in years	Float
credit_score	Credit score of the person	Integer
previous_loan_defaults_on_file	Indicator of previous loan defaults	Categorical
loan_status (target variable)	Loan approval status: 1 = approved; 0 = rejected	Integer

3. Data Usage
The dataset can be used for multiple purposes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze key features, distribution patterns, and relationships to understand credit risk factors.
Classification: Build predictive models to classify the loan_status variable (approved/not approved) for potential applicants.
Regression: Develop regression models to predict the credit_score variable based on individual and loan-related attributes.
Mind the data issue from the original data, such as the instance > 100-year-old as age.

This dataset provides a rich basis for understanding financial risk factors and simulating predictive modeling processes for loan approval and credit scoring.
